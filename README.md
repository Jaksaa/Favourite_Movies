# Favourite_Movies
Create own site with all time favourite movies on predifined template.

In this project I have tackled problems with usage of Flask, SQLALchemy and communication with API.

The project is simple - personal library for all time favourite movies.

At the beginning you need to make an account on TMDB in order to get API key, crucial for making requests.
Then set it as a variable API_KEY.
Also provide your personal SERCRET_KEY.

If all the above terms are met we can simply make our server run and create library :)
